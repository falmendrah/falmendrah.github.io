My name is Félix Almendra Hernández and I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, under the guidance of  [Jesús A. De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera"). 

I earned my M.A. in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2022 and a B.S. in Mathematics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I wrote a senior thesis under the supervision of [Omar Antolín Camarena](https://www.matem.unam.mx/~omar/).

My research focuses on the application of algebra and combinatorics to address problems in probability and statistics. Currently, I'm working on applications and understanding of Markov bases for Exponential Random Graph Models. I'm always eager to explore new research opportunities in these or related areas.

Beyond academia, I'm seeking avenues to leverage my analytical background to tackle challenges across various industries.

Feel free to reach out to me at falmendrahernandez (at) ucdavis (dot) edu.
