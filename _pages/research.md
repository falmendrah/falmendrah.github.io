My research interests lie in the interaction between algebra, combinatorics, probability and statistics. More specifically, throughout my mathematical journey I have worked on projects in the fields of algebraic statistics, polyhedral geometry and algebraic combinatorics. I'm always in the lookout for new and exciting research directions.
